### **Project Description**

This AI-driven platform is designed to streamline access to government schemes and services, making it easier for individuals to discover, understand, and avail of the benefits of various government programs. The platform leverages Artificial Intelligence to verify documents, automate the discovery of eligible schemes based on personal profiles, and provide personalized guidance throughout the application process. By simplifying the process of finding relevant government schemes and offering tailored assistance, the platform empowers citizens to access their rightful benefits efficiently. It is built to enhance the user experience, ensuring that individuals can navigate government services with ease and clarity. The solution is inspired by the comprehensive listing of government schemes available on [MyScheme](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/).

### For Aadhaar verifier application:-

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies: **Flask** for building the web application (`pip install Flask`), **pdf2image** to convert PDF files into images (`pip install pdf2image`), **Pillow** (PIL Fork) for image manipulation (`pip install Pillow`), **easyocr** for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images (`pip install easyocr`), **NumPy** for numerical computations (`pip install numpy`), and **OpenCV** for computer vision tasks (`pip install opencv-python`). If you're on Windows, you'll also need to install **Poppler** for `pdf2image`. To install all the required libraries, you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` after cloning the repository.

### Milestones Achieved

- Developed an **Aadhaar Verifier Website** that validates the authenticity of Aadhaar cards, helping to detect fraudulent uploads. If the Aadhaar card is verified as genuine, the data extracted from it can be securely stored in a database. This data is then utilized to suggest personalized government schemes based on the individual's details, enhancing the user experience and streamlining the process of accessing relevant benefits.
